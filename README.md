# HelpEasy.ReactNative
Make helping those experiencing homelessness, easy.

# Functionality
HelpEasy is a tool to help people be helpful when they encounter people on the streets experiencing homelessness. Using the user's location, returns a list of nearby homeless shelters and their relevent contact information. Additionally, walks the user through the encounter, detailing steps to take to make helping easy.

# Why HelpEasy?
Anyone can use Google Maps to find nearby homeless shelters. So, why HelpEasy? The answer is simple: "The best tool is the one that you actually use." With a clean, focused UI, and step-by-step instructions, HelpEasy is designed to be the tool that actually gets used.

I imagine religious groups, non-profits, and other community-minded individuals using and promoting HelpEasy as a tool to facilitate outreach.

# Bugs, Questions, and Ideas
At present, I'm unsure if I will ever take the app to production. That said, I can be reached by email at cloughessybenjamin@gmail.com
